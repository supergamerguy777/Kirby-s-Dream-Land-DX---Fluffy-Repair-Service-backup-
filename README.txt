Welcome! This is a backup for the "Kirby's Dream Land DX - Fluffy Repair Service" fix. 
The download was recently removed from romhacking.net, so I figured I would make 
a backup for anyone out there looking to apply this wonderful project to the base 
DX hack for KDL. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
NOTE: I could not find a standalone version of the Fluffy Repair Service patch, so 
I have included a patch that has the base DX hack, the Revised hack, and the 
Fluffy Repair Service hack all rolled into one, so this will be all you need.
I'm very sorry that I do not have the "Plus" version available with the 
Kirby's-Adventure-styled HUD.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The information for the "Fluffy Repair Service" hack has been copied 
from the RHDN README file and pasted below. I hope you enjoy!

CREDITS: I will attritribute this patch to "minucce", as that's who is credited on RHDN, 
though I want to offer a huge "Thank You!" to whoever developed this patch.
